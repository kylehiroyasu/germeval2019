## GermEval 2019

This project is just my personal attempt to see how various methodologies I am familiar with can perform on the GermEval 2019 Dataset.

I find this collaborative exercise of interest because it generates a plethora of published works attempting to solve the problem.

## Data and Task Description:

https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/resources/data/germeval-2019-hmc/1stcall.txt

## Notebooks:

The notebooks will be predominantly sequential with an effort to push code into a module/script for resuability.
